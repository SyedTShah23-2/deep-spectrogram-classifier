# deep-spectrogram-classifier
A pipeline for transforming .wav audio files into spectrogram images for classification using deep learning models like ViT, EfficientNet, and custom Transformers. The project includes audio preprocessing, spectrogram generation, and training of vision-based models to classify audio data using PyTorch.
